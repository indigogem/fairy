### Fairy Engine v0.5

This is a lightweight yet powerful 2d game framework build around Marmalade SDK.

The main idea is to create as compact and fast as possible 2d game engine (inspired by Haaf's game engine), yet easy to use.

What is you get:
- fast render (sprite batching)
- handy level structure
- xml level represantation with objects templates (using tinyxml)
- particles
- animated sprites
- automatic input scale to virtual coordinates
- processing input gestures (zoom in/out)

What is in development:
- 2d physics (Box2d)
- Lua scripts
- GUI
